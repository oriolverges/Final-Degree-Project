### Scripts for the Genetic Algorithms
***
This folder contains the scripts of the different approaches to Genetic Algorithms:
- **1_GA_Basic.py:** Basic approach of a genetic algorithm.
- **2_GA_Annealing.py:** Approach incorporating annealing.
- **3_GA_Elitism.py:** Approach incorporating selection of elites.
- **4_GA_Montecarlo.py:** Incorporation of selection of individuals through fitness probability distribution.
- **auxiliary_functions.py:** All functions related to fitness computations together with some preprocessing.
- **data:** Directory containing sequences of **protein1* and **protein2* (used for parametrization) and **4FC* (comparison of Elitism and Montecarlo).
